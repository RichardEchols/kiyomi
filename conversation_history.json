    "content": "# ScribbleStokes \u2192 1,000 Subs in 90 Days\n\nAlright Richard, let me lay this out. ScribbleStokes is societal commentary with images + voiceover \u2014 that's a format that can absolutely blow up with the right strategy. Here's the plan:\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-14)\n\n**Content Engine**\n- **Upload schedule:** 3 videos/week (Mon, Wed, Fri) \u2014 consistency is the algorithm's best friend\n- **Video length:** 8-15 minutes (sweet spot for watch time + mid-roll ads once you monetize)\n- **Batch production:** Script and record 6 videos at a time so you stay ahead\n\n**Channel Optimization**\n- Nail the channel banner, profile pic, and \"About\" section \u2014 clear value prop: *what does a viewer GET from subscribing?*\n- Create a channel trailer (60-90 sec) that hooks new visitors\n- Organize playlists by topic so viewers binge\n\n**SEO & Discoverability**\n- Every video gets keyword-researched titles, descriptions, and tags\n- I'll handle this for every upload \u2014 titles that make people CLICK, not just describe\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Growth Engine (Days 15-60)\n\n**Content Strategy \u2014 Ride the Trends**\n- 1 video/week on a trending societal topic (news cycle, viral debate, cultural moment) \u2014 these get search traffic\n- 1 video/week on evergreen commentary (topics people always search: money, relationships, culture shifts)\n- 1 video/week that's a \"spicy take\" or contrarian angle \u2014 these get shared and debated in comments\n\n**Shorts Strategy (This is the cheat code)**\n- **5 Shorts/week** pulled from your long-form content \u2014 clip the best 30-60 second moments\n- Shorts are how small channels explode right now. One viral Short can bring 500+ subs overnight\n- I'll script standalone Shorts too \u2014 punchy, visual, shareable\n\n**Cross-Promotion**\n- Every video gets posted to X with a hook clip\n- Pin comment on every video driving to the next video or playlist\n- Community posts 2x/week (polls, questions, preview images) to boost engagement signals\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Acceleration (Days 60-90)\n\n**Collaboration & Outreach**\n- Identify 10-15 channels in the same niche (commentary, societal analysis) with 1K-50K subs\n- Pitch collabs: guest commentary, reaction videos, shared topics\n- Even 2-3 collabs can bring 100-300 subs each\n\n**Audience Activation**\n- End every video with a specific CTA: \"Subscribe if you think for yourself\" \u2014 give them an identity to join\n- Reply to EVERY comment in the first 48 hours (boosts the algorithm AND builds community)\n- Run a \"1,000 sub countdown\" in Community tab to create momentum\n\n**Paid Boost (Optional \u2014 Only With Your Approval)**\n- If we're close but need a push, $50-100 in YouTube ads on your best-performing video can close the gap\n- Only if you greenlight it\n\n---\n\n## The Numbers\n\n| Metric | Target |\n|---|---|\n| Videos published | 36-40 long-form + 60+ Shorts |\n| Avg views per video (by month 3) | 500-2,000 |\n| Subscriber conversion rate | 5-10% of viewers |\n| Shorts viral hits needed | 2-3 that break 10K views |\n\n---\n\n## What I Handle vs What You Do\n\n**Me (Kiyo",

    "content": "# ScribbleStokes \u2192 1,000 Subs in 90 Days\n\nRichard, here's the playbook. ScribbleStokes \u2014 societal commentary with images + voiceover \u2014 is a format built for virality. Short, punchy, shareable. Let's capitalize on that.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-14)\n\n**Upload Cadence**\n- 5 videos/week minimum (short-form: 3-8 min)\n- 3 YouTube Shorts/week repurposed from full videos\n- Every video ends with a strong CTA: \"Subscribe if you think for yourself\"\n\n**Channel Optimization**\n- Banner, profile pic, and About section dialed in \u2014 clean, bold, memorable\n- Playlists organized by topic (tech & society, culture, money, etc.)\n- Channel trailer: 60-second sizzle reel of your hardest-hitting clips\n\n**SEO & Discovery**\n- Every title is a hook. No boring titles. Think: \"Nobody Talks About This\" / \"They Don't Want You To Know\" / \"I Changed My Mind About...\"\n- Tags, descriptions, and thumbnails optimized per video\n- I'll research trending commentary topics weekly and queue them up\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Growth Engine (Days 15-45)\n\n**Shorts Strategy**\n- This is the #1 growth lever right now. Shorts feed the algorithm and funnel viewers to long-form\n- Take the most controversial or thought-provoking 30-60 seconds from each video \u2192 Shorts\n- Target 5-7 Shorts/week\n\n**Cross-Promotion**\n- Post clips on X with links back to full videos\n- Share on Reddit in relevant communities (r/DeepThoughts, r/socialmedia, r/unpopularopinion, etc.)\n- Pin comment on every video linking to the next one\n\n**Collaboration / Engagement**\n- Comment on 10-15 similar creators' videos daily (genuine takes, not spam)\n- Identify 3-5 commentary channels in the 5K-50K range for potential collabs or shoutouts\n- Engage with every single comment on your videos for the first 48 hours\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Acceleration (Days 46-90)\n\n**Double Down on What Works**\n- By now we'll have data. Which topics get the most views? Which thumbnails get clicked? We go harder on those\n- A/B test thumbnails on top-performing videos\n- Create \"series\" around winning topics to build binge-watching behavior\n\n**Community Building**\n- Community tab posts 3x/week (polls, hot takes, questions)\n- Build an email list or Discord for the most engaged viewers\n- Tease upcoming videos to build anticipation\n\n**Milestone Push**\n- At 750+ subs, create a \"Road to 1K\" video \u2014 audiences love rooting for creators\n- Pinned comment on every video: \"We're pushing to 1,000 \u2014 hit subscribe if you rock with the content\"\n\n---\n\n## The Numbers\n\n| Metric | Target |\n|---|---|\n| Videos/week | 5 long-form + 5-7 Shorts |\n| Views/video (avg by Day 45) | 500-1,000 |\n| Sub conversion rate | 5-8% of viewers |\n| Shorts views (avg) | 2,000-10,000 |\n| Total subs by Day 90 | 1,000+ |\n\n---\n\n## What I Handle vs. What You Do\n\n**Me (Kiyomi):**\n- Research trending topics weekly\n- Write titles, descriptions, tags for every video\n- Draft thumbnail concepts\n- Create Shorts cut lists\n- Schedule cross-promotion on X\n- Track analytics and adjust strategy weekly\n\n**You (Richard)",

We merge into one plan. This is the big one \u2014 you want it done before the video.\n\n2. **7-Day X Content Calendar** \u2014 What we post, when, what format, what hooks. We've got the x-api skill, Metricool for scheduling, and the social media analyzer ready to go.\n\n3. **RE_LawManager Marketing Package** \u2014 I started this at 2 AM (pitch email for Chris, pricing page concept, onboarding guide). Need to finish it.\n\n4. **Monetization Strategy** \u2014 Brock listed 5 revenue paths (AI Agency, YouTube flywheel, skills marketplace, RE_LawManager, consulting). My job is to pick the fastest path and build a go-to-market for what we can monetize THIS WEEK.\n\n5. **Any extra monetization ideas** I bring to the table.\n\n---\n\n## My Take\n\nThe **AI Agency business plan** is the priority since you want it before the video. The fastest money is a combo of:\n- **AI Agency consulting** (set up AI assistants for businesses, $500-2K/mo)\n- **RE_LawManager** as the first case study (Chris trial proves the model)\n\nI'll start cranking on the business plan \u2014 my sections \u2014 right now. Want me to go ahead and knock these out in order? Or do you want to reprioritize anything?",
