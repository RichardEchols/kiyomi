## Week 1 (Feb 2-6)

### Monday - Build in Public
**Hook:** "I built a full SaaS app in one weekend with AI. Here's the stack:"
**Body:** Breakdown of True Podcasts - Next.js + Tailwind + Supabase + ElevenLabs. Show the UI. Mention it's live. End with "AI won't replace developers. Developers using AI will replace developers not using it."
**Media:** Screenshot of True Podcasts app
**CTA:** "What would you build if you could ship in 48 hours?"

### Wednesday - Business
**Hook:** "I charge $2,500-$10,000 per app. Here's why clients happily pay:"
**Body:** Break down the value: custom-built, no templates, ongoing support, they own the code. Compare to $50/mo SaaS tools that don't fit. "A $5,000 app that saves 10 hours/week pays for itself in 2 months."
**Media:** Simple pricing tier graphic (can use Canva)
**CTA:** "DM me if you need a custom app for your business."

### Friday - Personality
**Hook:** "The best business advice I ever got wasn't from a course. It was from Proverbs 22:29."
**Body:** "Do you see a man skillful in his work? He will stand before kings." Get excellent at one thing. Everything else follows. I chose building apps. What did you choose?
**Media:** None (text post)
**CTA:** "What skill are you going all-in on?"

## Week 2 (Feb 9-13)

### Monday - Build in Public
**Hook:** "Just shipped a client app in 5 days. Here's what a $5K build looks like:"
**Body:** Walk through a client project (use RE LawManager as example without naming the client). Dashboard UI, clean design, mobile responsive. "Apple-level polish on a freelancer budget."
**Media:** Screenshot/mockup of dashboard UI
**CTA:** "Building apps for small businesses is the most underrated freelance niche."

### Wednesday - Business
**Hook:** "Stop selling hours. Start selling outcomes. Here's how I price my apps:"
**Body:** 3-tier breakdown. Simple ($1-2K), Medium ($2.5-5K), Complex ($5-10K). Every app includes monthly subscription for hosting + support ($75-350/mo). "Recurring revenue is how you build a real business."
**Media:** Simple tier list graphic
**CTA:** "What's your pricing model? Drop it below."

### Friday - Personality
**Hook:** "I have an AI assistant that works while I sleep. No, seriously."
**Body:** Talk about Kiyomi/the AI workflow. "Every night at 2:30 AM, my AI assistant reviews code, drafts content, and prepares my morning brief. I wake up to progress. The future of solo dev is having a team of AIs."
**Media:** Screenshot of morning brief or workspace
**CTA:** "Are you using AI as a tool or as a teammate?"

**CTA:** "What's your go-to stack?"

### Wednesday - Business

**CTA:** "The best time to start freelancing was yesterday. The second best time is today."

### Friday - Personality
**Hook:** "Unpopular opinion: Most developers overcomplicate everything."

**Media:** None (text post)
**CTA:** "Agree or disagree?"

## Week 4 (Feb 23-27)

### Monday - Build in Public
**Hook:** "Built a podcast generator that turns any topic into a two-host show. Here's a demo:"
**Body:** Quick demo of True Podcasts. Input a topic, AI writes the script, ElevenLabs speaks it. "This took me one weekend. What used to take a production team now takes one developer."
**Media:** Screen recording or audio clip
**CTA:** "What would you automate if you could?"

### Wednesday - Business
**Hook:** "The $75/month email that changed my freelance business:"
**Body:** Monthly subscriptions are the game. Build once, get paid forever. Hosting + support + updates. "3 clients at $200/mo = $600/mo passive. 10 clients = $2,000/mo. That's before any new builds."
**Media:** Simple math breakdown graphic
**CTA:** "If you're freelancing without recurring revenue, you're leaving money on the table."

**CTA:** "What does your ideal work day look like?"
