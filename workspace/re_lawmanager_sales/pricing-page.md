### FAQ

**Can I migrate my existing data?**
Yes. We'll help you import cases, contacts, and documents during onboarding.

**Is there a contract?**
No. Month-to-month. Cancel anytime.

**What about HIPAA / data security?**
Data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Hosted on enterprise-grade infrastructure with automatic backups.

*Notes for Richard:*
- These prices are a starting point — adjust based on Chris's feedback and what the market bears
- Clio's actual pricing: $39-$89/user/mo, so a 3-person firm pays $117-$267/mo before add-ons
- Consider offering Chris a "founding client" rate (e.g., $99/mo locked in for life) to close fast
- The 14-day trial is already effectively happening since Brock set up his account
