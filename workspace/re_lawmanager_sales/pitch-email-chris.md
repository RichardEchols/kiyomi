# Pitch Email for Chris

**Subject:** Your firm is already set up in RE LawManager — take a look

---

Chris,

I built something for you.

RE LawManager is a case management platform designed specifically for personal injury attorneys. Instead of showing you a blank dashboard and asking you to imagine it, I went ahead and set up your firm.

**When you log in, you'll see:**
- 10 active PI cases with real case data, timelines, and status tracking
- Your contacts organized — clients, opposing counsel, adjusters, experts
- Billing already structured — track hours, costs, and settlements per case
- Task management so nothing falls through the cracks
- Document upload built in — drag, drop, done

This isn't a demo. It's your actual workspace. Start using it today and everything you add is yours.

**What makes this different from Clio or PracticePanther:**
- Built for PI firms, not generalist law practices
- No bloat — you get case management, billing, contacts, tasks, and documents without 40 features you'll never touch
- Setup takes minutes, not weeks
- Pricing that doesn't scale against you as you grow

I'd love to get your feedback after you spend 15 minutes in it. If it works for your practice, we'll talk about keeping it running long-term at a price that makes sense.

**Your login is ready.** I'll send credentials separately.

Talk soon,
Richard

*Notes for Richard:*
- Swap in actual login URL and credentials
- Send credentials in a separate message/email for security
- Follow up 24-48 hours after he logs in
