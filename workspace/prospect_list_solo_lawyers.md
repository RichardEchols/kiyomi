## Outreach Templates

### Email Template - RE Attorney
```
Subject: Quick question about [Firm Name]'s case management

Hi [Name],

I build custom practice management tools for solo real estate attorneys.

I noticed [specific observation about their practice - multi-state, high volume, etc.].

I've built RE_LawManager - a tool specifically designed for real estate law workflows:
closings tracking, document management, client portal, and deadline automation.

Would a 15-minute demo be worth your time this week?

RMDW LLC
```

### Email Template - General Solo
```
Subject: Your clients are checking your website right now

Hi [Name],

74% of potential clients check a lawyer's website before calling.
Only 30% find what they need.

I build modern client portals and websites for solo attorneys -
online intake, case status tracking, and professional design that converts.

Want to see what that looks like for [practice area] attorneys?

### LinkedIn DM Template
```
Hi [Name] - I see you're running a solo [practice area] practice in [city].
I build custom apps for solo attorneys (client portals, intake automation, case management).
Would love to connect.
